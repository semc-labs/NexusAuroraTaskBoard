    "paper mod": ["Originally done by ChromePcok using Deskey film scrap on a Cream housing. This mod is meant to push the leaf forward to cause tactile stems have a more agressive tactile bump in linear housings. Switch#2526 converted the mod to using folded paper because he just didn't have Deskey films. Place the Deskey scrap or paper between the back of the bottom housing and the back of the leaf. Varying the amount of paper/layers will increase and decrease the amount of tactility.
